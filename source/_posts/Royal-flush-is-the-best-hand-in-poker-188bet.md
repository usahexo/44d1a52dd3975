#  Royal flush is the best hand in poker 188bet

There are many different variants of poker, but the basic premise is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of seven cards. The Royal flush is the best possible hand, and it is composed of a straight flush with all 10s, Js, Qs, Ks, and As.

It's important to know what hands are in play when you're playing poker. The Royal flush is the best hand that you can have, followed by a flush, four of a kind, full house, three of a kind, two pair, and one pair. An Ace can be used as either the highest or lowest card in a straight or flush, so those hands are both equally strong.

When it comes to winning poker hands, sometimes you just have to know when to fold. If you're holding anything less than a Royal flush and there are better hands at the table, it's best to fold and wait for the next hand. There's no point in risking your chips when you don't have the best hand.

If you're lucky enough to get dealt a Royal flush, congratulations! You're almost guaranteed to win the pot. In fact, most casinos will payout odds of 4000:1 for this particular hand. So make sure you know what the best possible hands are when you're playing poker; that way you'll always have something to shoot for.

#  Straight flush not far behind royal flush

Straight flushes and royal flushes are the two most powerful poker hands. A straight flush is made up of five consecutive cards of the same suit, while a royal flush is a hand that contains an ace, king, queen, jack and ten of the same suit.

Despite their similar power, a royal flush is much more rare than a straight flush. In fact, a royal flush is only beaten by four other types of hands - a natural royal flush (A-K-Q-J-10), four of a kind (four cards of the same rank), a full house (three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank) and a straight (five consecutive cards).

This means that if you're playing against someone who has a royal flush, you're pretty much out of luck. However, if you have a straight flush, you still have a decent chance of winning the hand. In fact, according to The Poker Player's Bible by Lou Krieger, the odds of being dealt a straight flush are about 1 in 65,000, while the odds of being dealt a royal flush are just 1 in 649,740.

So if you're looking to win some big money at poker, it's important to know what these two hands are. And if you're lucky enough to be dealt either one, don't be too quick to fold - you may still have a chance to take down the pot.

#  Four of a kind still beats full house!

There are many different variations of poker, and each has its own set of rules. However, most versions of the game share one common objective: to win money by beating your opponents’ hands.

One of the key decisions you must make during any poker game is when to fold. This means giving up your hand and losing any potential winnings you may have had up until that point. The decision to fold can be a difficult one, but it’s often the best option if your cards aren’t looking good.

One common misconception about poker is that a four of a kind always beats a full house. This is not always the case! In some versions of the game, such as Texas Hold’em, a full house can actually beat a four of a kind. So before you start smashing all your chips into the pot, make sure you know the rules of the game you’re playing!

#  Poker 188bet: What are the winning hands? 

When playing poker, the hands you are dealt can be the difference between winning and losing. While all hands are important, some are more valuable than others. In this article, we will take a look at the top five winning hands in poker.

The Winning Hand #1: Royal Flush

A royal flush is the best possible hand in poker and consists of a straight flush made up of the five highest ranking cards available. This hand is almost impossible to beat and is therefore very valuable.

The Winning Hand #2: Four of a Kind

A four of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank. This hand is usually beaten by a royal flush, but can still be very valuable if played correctly.

The Winning Hand #3: Full House

A full house is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. This hand is often considered to be one of the strongest hands in poker and can be very difficult to beat.

The Winning Hand #4: Flush

A flush is made up of five cards all of the same suit. This hand can be very powerful if played correctly, but it is important to remember that it can easily be beaten by other hands.

The Winning Hand #5: Straight

A straight is made up of five consecutive cards, all of different suits. This hand can be very strong if played correctly, but should not be underestimated as it can easily be beaten by other hands.

#  Find out what the best hands are in poker 188bet!

If you’re looking to up your poker game, understanding the best hands to play is key. Not all hands are created equal – some are much stronger than others. In this article, we’ll take a look at the best poker hands and give you a few tips on how to play them.

The strongest poker hand is known as a royal flush. This is made up of the 10, jack, queen, king and ace of the same suit. This hand is unbeatable, so if you’re lucky enough to get one, make sure you bet big!

Apart from a royal flush, the next strongest hand is a straight flush. This is made up of five consecutive cards all of the same suit. If you have four of these cards in your hand, keep an eye out for the fifth to make your straight flush!

Three of a kind is another very strong hand. This is made up of three cards of the same rank. If you have two pairs in your hand, watch out for the fifth card to make your three of a kind.

Two pair is also a very strong hand. This is made up of two different pairs of cards. If you have one pair in your hand, watch out for the other two cards to make your two pairs.

One pair is still a strong hand and can be very useful when playing poker. This is made up of two cards of the same rank. Keep an eye on the other three cards to make sure you don’t miss out on any potential winning combinations!

Finally, we have high card which isn’t really a hand at all but can still be useful when playing poker. This simply means that you don’t have any of the above combinations in your hand but that your highest card is still higher than your opponent’s highest card.
