#  Obama authorizes airstrikes in Syria

On September 23, 2014, President Obama authorized U.S. airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Sunni Islamist militant group that has been wreaking havoc in Syria and Iraq. The authorization came one week after Obama gave a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in which he laid out a strategy to combat ISIL.

The airstrikes have been successful in stopping ISIL's advance and have even helped some Kurdish fighters retake territory from the militants. However, they have also resulted in civilian casualties, which has drawn criticism from some who argue that the U.S. should not be getting involved in another Middle Eastern conflict.

Obama has defended the airstrikes, saying that they are necessary to protect American national security interests and to prevent ISIL from establishing a safe haven in Syria. He has also emphasized that they are not part of a wider campaign to overthrow Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.

#  U.S. launches first airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria

The United States announced late Wednesday that it had launched its first airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria.

"These strikes were conducted as part of the President's comprehensive strategy to degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL," a statement from the administration said, using an alternate acronym for the militant group.

The strikes, which hit near the Syrian city of Kobani, were meant to "disrupt ISIL's ability to operate from Syria," according to the Pentagon.

U.S. officials have been increasingly eager to take on ISIS in Syria, where the militants have taken over large swaths of territory and declared an Islamic caliphate.

But Wednesday's strikes come only after weeks of U.S. airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq, where the militants have also taken over large areas.

On Tuesday, Iraqi forces recaptured the key town of Bayji from ISIS, dealing a significant blow to the militant group's operations in Iraq.

#  How the U.S. can defeat ISIS in Syria

In order to defeat ISIS in Syria, the United States government would need to first come up with a clear and concise strategy. After formulating said strategy, the next step would be to execute it with precision and expertise. By doing so, the United States could finally put an end to the terrorist group’s reign of terror in the region.

So what would a strategy for defeating ISIS in Syria look like? To begin with, it’s important to understand that there is no one-size-fits-all solution; different approaches may be necessary in different parts of the country. However, there are some general principles that should be followed.

First and foremost, any strategy must emphasize the importance of working with local forces on the ground. This is essential for two reasons: first, it allows us to take advantage of local knowledge and expertise; and second, it reduces the risk of civilian casualties.

Another key element of any successful strategy is coordination with our allies and partners. This includes not only other countries in the region, but also our NATO allies. By working together we can more effectively share information and resources, and reduce the chances of accidental conflict.

Finally, any strategy must be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions on the ground. The situation in Syria is constantly evolving, so our approach needs to be able to adapt as well. This may include things like adjusting our target list or deploying additional troops or equipment as needed.

So how can we put all of this into action? Here is a hypothetical timeline of how a U.S.-led campaign against ISIS in Syria might play out:

Phase 1: Preparation (3 months)

In this phase we would work with our allies and partners to develop a comprehensive plan for defeating ISIS in Syria. We would also begin mobilizing troops and equipment for use in the campaign.

Phase 2: Phase 1: Execution (3 months)
Living up to its name, this phase would involve carrying out our plans on the ground. We would work closely with local forces to retake territory from ISIS while minimizing civilian casualties. Additionally, we would continue coordinating with our allies and partners as needed.

#  5 things you need to know about the air campaign against ISIS in Syria

In September of 2014, United States President Barack Obama announced a strategy to "degrade and ultimately destroy" the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). One key part of this strategy is the air campaign against ISIS in Syria. The United States and its allies have conducted over 8,000 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria as of January 2018.

So, what has been the result of the air campaign against ISIS in Syria? Here are five things you need to know:

1. The air campaign has killed a large number of ISIS fighters.

One reason the air campaign has been successful is that it has killed a large number of ISIS fighters. As of January 2018, the United States military estimates that the air campaign has killed over 60,000 ISIS fighters. This has significantly weakened ISIS and reduced its ability to carry out terrorist attacks.

2. The air campaign has destroyed many ISIS targets.

The airstrikes have also destroyed many ISIS targets. As of January 2018, the United States military estimates that the airstrikes have destroyed over 20,000 ISIS targets, including tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, and headquarters buildings. This has significantly hampered ISIS' ability to wage war in Syria.

3. The air campaign has led to the liberation of many Syrian cities and towns from ISIS control.

The airstrikes have also helped lead to the liberation of many Syrian cities and towns from ISIS control. In October 2017, for example, Iraqi Security Forces and their allies liberated Mosul - the largest city ever held by ISIS - after a nine-month long battle that was largely conducted with airstrikes from the United States and its allies. This demonstrates that the air campaign is making significant progress in defeating ISIS in Syria.

4. The air campaign has also caused civilian casualties.

However, it is important to note that the air campaign has also caused civilian casualties. In October 2017, for example, US-led coalition airstrikes killed at least 100 people in Raqqa - then the de facto capital of ISIS - including dozens of civilians who were attempting to flee from the city. This raises questions about whether or not enough is being done to avoid civilian casualties in airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria.

#  U.S., allies launch airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria

The United States and key allies launched airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria early Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2014, U.S. officials said.

The operation, which includes attacks by warplanes and Cruise missiles from ships in the Mediterranean Sea, is intended to damage the militant group's infrastructure and disrupt its ability to carry out terrorist attacks. It is also an effort to help protect civilians trapped in the area by the militants.

"Our objective is clear: We will degrade and ultimately destroy ISIL so that it can no longer threaten our people or our allies," President Barack Obama said in a televised address Monday night announcing the airstrikes.

The president authorized "targeted air strikes" against Islamic State militants in Iraq on Aug. 7 after they had made advances across northern Iraq, including the capture of the Mosul Dam, which could have given them the ability to flood major Iraqi cities.

In addition to attacking Islamic State targets in Syria, U.S. military planes dropped food and water to thousands of Yazidis who have been trapped on a mountaintop near Sinjar since August being pelted with mortar rounds by Islamic State fighters below them.
