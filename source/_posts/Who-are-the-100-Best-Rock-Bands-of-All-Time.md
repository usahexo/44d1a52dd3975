The Doors were pioneers of psychedelic rock in the 1960s, while Pink Floyd produced some of the most experimental music of all time. Journey is well-known for their arena-rock ballads like “Don’t Stop Believin’,” and Aerosmith is one of the most successful American groups ever thanks to hits like “Dream On” and “Walk This Way.” And who could forget about Guns N Roses?

Hüsker Dü were one of the first hardcore punk bands ever formed, while Nirvana spearheaded grunge music in the early 1990s.
