#  Which wins the tie in baccarat - OHenry?

In baccarat, the two hands being compared are the player's hand and the banker's hand. The hand with the highest value wins. If both hands have the same value, then it is a tie and both players lose. The rank of cards is ace (1 point), 2 to 9 (face value), 10 (10 points), jack (11 points), queen (12 points), and king (13 points).

There are three possible outcomes in baccarat - Player Win, Banker Win, and Tie. 

Assuming both hands have different values, here are the chances of each outcome:
Player Win: 44.62%
Banker Win: 45.85%
Tie: 9.53%

#  Who won the tie in baccarat - OHenry or the casino?

When you play baccarat, there are two possible outcomes: you or the casino can win. So, who really won the tie in baccarat - OHenry or the casino?

The answer is OHenry. Most people think that the casino always wins, but this isn't actually true. In fact, if both you and the casino have the same number of points, you win the tie. This is why OHenry won the tie in baccarat - he had more points than the casino.

If you're not sure how to play baccarat, don't worry - it's a very simple game. There are three possible outcomes: player (you), banker (the casino), and tie. The aim of the game is to get as close to 9 as possible - 3 points is called a 'standoff'.

If you're playing against the casino, you can bet on either yourself or the banker. If you bet on yourself and lose, your bet gets taken by the casino; if you bet on the banker and lose, your bet gets taken by OHenry. If you and the casino have the same number of points, your bet is returned to you.

So, now that you know who really won the tie in baccarat, why not give it a go yourself? It's a great game for beginners and there's plenty of excitement when the stakes are high!
