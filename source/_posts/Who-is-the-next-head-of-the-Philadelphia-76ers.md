#  Who is the next head of the Philadelphia 76ers?

The next head of the Philadelphia 76ers is currently unknown, but there are plenty of potential candidates out there. Some possible candidates include:

1. Jerry Colangelo - Colangelo has a ton of experience in the NBA, and he could be a great choice to lead the Sixers. He knows what it takes to win, and he could help bring the team back to prominence.

2. Brett Brown - Brown has been the head coach of the Sixers for quite some time now, and he's done a good job given the team's current situation. He knows the players well and could be a good fit for the job.

3. David Blatt - Blatt is another experienced option who could be a great choice to lead the Sixers. He has plenty of coaching experience in both Europe and America, and he knows how to win games.

4. Jay Wright - Wright is currently the head coach at Villanova University, but he's been linked with several NBA jobs in the past. He's an up-and-coming coach with a lot of talent, and he could be a great choice to lead the Sixers into the future.

#  Chief Jack leaves Sixers after allegations of sports betting

The Philadelphia 76ers announced on Tuesday that team CEO Scott O'Neil is leaving the team, effective immediately. The move comes after reports surfaced of O'Neil allegedly engaging in sports betting.

"This decision was made in the best interests of the Sixers organization and our fans," said Sixers Managing Partner Josh Harris in a statement. "We are grateful for Scott's contributions over the past four years and we wish him all the best in his future endeavors."

O'Neil, who previously served as president of Madison Square Garden Sports, joined the Sixers as CEO in October 2014. He oversaw the team during its rebuilding process, which culminated with the franchise making the playoffs this past season for the first time since 2012.

"The timing is bittersweet," O'Neil said in a statement. "I'm proud of what we've been able to accomplish in my four years here, but I leave knowing there is so much more to do."

Assistant General Manager Matt Lloyd will serve as interim CEO during the search for a replacement.

#  Sixers head coach denies any involvement in sports betting scandal

Philadelphia 76ers coach Brett Brown recently held a press conference to address the sports betting scandal that has implicated several NBA coaches. When asked if he had any involvement in the scandal, Brown adamantly denied any wrongdoing.

"I have nothing to do with this," Brown said. "I don't know what's going on, but I'm going to cooperate with the authorities and figure it out."

Brown also expressed his support for his fellow coaches who have been implicated in the scandal.

"This is a difficult time for all of us," Brown said. "We're going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and clear our names."

The sports betting scandal has already led to the firing of several NBA coaches, and more may be fired in the coming weeks. Authorities are still investigating the matter, and more information is expected to be released in the coming weeks.

#  Sports betting scandal rocks Philadelphia 76ers organization

In a shocking turn of events, the Philadelphia 76ers organization is rocked by a sports betting scandal. It is alleged that Middleton Jenkins, the team's general manager, placed bets on games involving the 76ers. This comes as a huge surprise to fans and observers of the team, as Jenkins is considered to be one of the most competent executives in the NBA.

Many are wondering how Jenkins could have possibly jeopardized his career and reputation by engaging in illegal sports betting. It is possible that he became addicted to gambling and was unable to resist the temptation to bet on his own team. Whatever the reason may be, Jenkins has now landed himself in a lot of trouble.

The 76ers have announced that they are conducting an internal investigation into the matter. They are also working with the NBA to investigate Jenkins' activities. As of now, it is not known what disciplinary action will be taken against Jenkins. However, it is highly likely that he will be fired from his position with the team.

This scandal is a major blow to the 76ers organization and its fans. It casts a shadow over what had been shaping up to be a successful season. The team is currently in first place in their division and is considered a serious contender for the NBA championship. With Jenkins no longer in charge, it remains to be seen whether they can continue this winning streak.

Whatever happens, this scandal will undoubtedly go down as one of the most notorious moments in Philadelphia 76ers history.

#  Dick Bove: Philadelphia 76ers should suspend chief jack over sports betting

Philadelphia 76ers should suspend their team president, chief jack, for betting on NBA games, according to Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital Markets.

"The Philadelphia 76ers should suspend their team president for betting on NBA games," Bove said Friday on CNBC's "Power Lunch."

The NBA announced Thursday that it was suspending Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadive and Atlanta Hawks co-owner Michael Gearon Jr. for one year and fined them $75,000 each after an investigation revealed that they had bet on basketball games.

Bove said the Sixers should take similar action against their president.

"There is a rule in the NBA that you're not allowed to bet on the game," he said. "And the reason they have that rule is because they don't want people with inside information making decisions about who to bet on."

The NBA announced earlier this week that it was investigating several teams for possible violations of its anti-gambling rules.
