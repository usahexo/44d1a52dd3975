#  Medication Appears to Help Gamblers Quit Addiction 

Some people who gamble may unintentionally develop an addiction to gambling. A new study suggests that some medication may help these people stop their addiction.

The study, which was published in JAMA Psychiatry, followed nearly 1,000 pathological gamblers for one year. The participants were randomly assigned to either a group that received medication or a group that received placebo pills.

The results of the study showed that the group that received medication had a lower rate of gambling relapse than the group that received placebo pills. The medication also appeared to be safe and well-tolerated.

While the study does not provide a cure for gambling addiction, it does suggest that medication may be an effective treatment for some people who struggle with this type of addiction.

#  Hope for Gambling Addicts: New Drug Shows Promise 

Despite increased awareness and availability of help, gambling addiction is a problem that continues to afflict many people. Gambling addictions can be incredibly harmful, ruining lives and relationships. But now there may be hope for those affected by this terrible disease.

A new drug has been developed that seems to help gambling addicts resist the urge to gamble. The drug, called nalmefene, has been shown to be effective in clinical trials. In one trial, participants who took nalmefene were less likely to gamble 3 months later than those who did not take the drug.

The researchers who developed nalmefene are hopeful that it can help gambling addicts achieve long-term abstinence from gambling. At this point, however, the drug is still in development and has not yet been approved for use by the FDA.

There is currently no cure for gambling addiction, and current treatments are often ineffective. So any new treatment that shows promise is very exciting news indeed. If nalmefene does turn out to be an effective treatment for gambling addiction, it could make a big difference in the lives of many people.

#  Antidepressant Appears to Assist in Recovery from Gambling Addiction 

Antidepressants may assist in the recovery of gambling addiction, a recent study suggests.

The study, which was published in the journal “Addiction,” found that sertraline – a drug commonly used to treat depression and anxiety – may help recovering gambling addicts stay abstinent from gambling.

For the study, researchers recruited 131 adult participants who were seeking treatment for problem gambling. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either sertraline or a placebo for eight weeks.

After eight weeks, those who had taken sertraline were less likely to have gambled in the previous week than those who had taken the placebo. Sertraline was also associated with lower levels of problem gambling symptoms.

The findings suggest that sertraline may be an effective treatment for recovering gambling addicts. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings.

#  Recovery from Gambling Addiction May Be Made Easier with New Drug 

Pathological gambling is a type of addiction that can be difficult to overcome. For some people, traditional treatments, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), may not be enough. Now, however, there may be a new drug that can help those struggling with gambling addiction recover more easily.

The drug, called nalmefene, has been shown to reduce relapse rates in people with gambling addiction. Nalmefene is a opioid blocker that has been used to treat alcohol addiction in the past. In a study involving over 200 people with gambling addiction, those who received nalmefene were less likely to relapse than those who did not receive the drug.

While nalmefene does not seem to be a cure-all for gambling addiction, it may be an effective tool for helping people recover from this type of addiction. If you are struggling with gambling addiction, talk to your doctor about whether nalmefene could be a good option for you.

#  Study Shows That Antidepressant May Help Recovering Gamblers

A study published in the journal “Addiction” has found that the antidepressant citalopram may help recovering gamblers.

The study, conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge, looked at whether citalopram could reduce urges to gamble and whether it could improve levels of happiness and well-being in recovering gamblers.

The study found that citalopram was effective in reducing urges to gamble and that it also improved levels of happiness and well-being in recovering gamblers.

The study’s lead author, Dr. Luke Clark, said that these findings suggest that citalopram may be a useful treatment for recovering gamblers.

“Our findings suggest that citalopram may be a useful treatment for recovering gamblers, as it can help to reduce urges to gamble and can improve levels of happiness and wellbeing,” said Clark.

Clark added that further research is needed to determine whether citalopram is an effective treatment for gambling addiction.
