#  Ilani Casino Adds Another Portland Stop to its Bus Route 

Ilani Casino Resort, located in Ridgefield, Washington, just across the Columbia River from Portland, Oregon, has long been a popular tourist destination. But with the recent addition of a Portland stop to its bus route, Ilani is making it easier than ever for Portlanders to visit.

The new bus route offers round-trip service from downtown Portland to Ilani and back. The trip takes about two hours each way and costs $20 per person. The bus makes one stop in downtown Portland and then proceeds directly to Ilani.

In addition to the new bus route, Ilani also offers free shuttle service from several locations in the Portland area. The shuttle service includes stops at the Rose Quarter Transit Center, Lloyd Center Mall, and Pioneer Courthouse Square.

Ilani is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The casino features 2,500 slot machines and more than 100 table games. It also has eight restaurants and bars, as well as a hotel with 304 rooms.

If you're looking for a fun day or night out in Portland, Ilani Casino Resort is definitely worth checking out.

#  Ilani Casino Continues its Expansion into the Portland Area 

When the Ilani Casino Resort opened its doors in Ridgefield, Washington, just outside of Portland, Oregon in April 2017, it was met with much fanfare. The $510 million facility is the largest casino in the Northwest, and its amenities are top-notch.

However, when it first opened, the Ilani Casino was only accessible to those living within a certain radius of the resort. This changed in November 2017 when the Ilani Casino began offering free shuttle service from three different locations in Portland. This made the casino much more accessible to those living in or visiting Portland, and as a result, business has been booming.

In fact, as recently as January 2019, it was announced that the Ilani Casino is expanding even further into the Portland area. A new 120-room hotel is being built on the property, and it is expected to be open by the end of 2020. This will make the Ilani Casino Resort one of the largest hotels in Oregon.

So why is the Ilani Casino doing so well? There are several reasons. First and foremost, it offers a wide variety of gaming options including slots, table games, and poker tournaments. It also has a world-class spa and some amazing restaurants. But perhaps most importantly, it offers an excellent customer experience. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and they go out of their way to make sure guests have a good time.

#  Ilani Casino Adds a new Stop in Portland for those looking to Gamble 

Ilani Casino Resort, which is about 30 minutes from Portland, has announced that it will open a satellite casino in the city. This is great news for those who live in or near Portland and are looking for a new casino to gamble at. The Ilani Casino Resort already offers a variety of gaming options, including blackjack, craps, roulette, and more than 1,700 slot machines. With the addition of the satellite casino in Portland, there will be even more opportunities to gamble and potentially win big prizes.

The Ilani Casino Resort is owned and operated by the Cowlitz Indian Tribe, a tribe that resides in Washington State. The satellite casino in Portland is expected to open in early 2020, and it will offer many of the same games that can be found at the main resort. It's important to note that this new casino will not be as large as the main resort; it will only have around 300 slot machines and a few table games. However, this satellite casino is still expected to be a popular destination for those living in or near Portland.

In addition to the new satellite casino in Portland, the Ilani Casino Resort is also planning to expand its main resort. A new hotel wing will be added to the property, which will include an additional 250 guest rooms. This expansion project is expected to be completed by late 2020. So if you're looking for a place to stay while you gamble in Portland, the Ilani Casino Resort should definitely be your top choice.
