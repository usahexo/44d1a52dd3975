#  What does this sponsorship mean for Wolfsburg?

After a long summer of speculation and doubt, it has finally been confirmed that Volkswagen is to become the new title sponsor of Bundesliga side Vfl Wolfsburg. The news was released on the club's website on Wednesday, with both parties confirming that the deal will run until 2021.

The obvious answer is money. Volkswagen is said to be pumping in €30 million per year into the sponsorship, which will go a long way in helping to stabilise the club financially. In addition to the money, Volkswagen will also be providing technological support to help improve the team's performance on the pitch. This could include anything from improving match analysis and coaching techniques through to providing specialist equipment for training sessions.

For Wolfsburg, this is an absolutely massive deal. Not only does it provide them with a reliable financial backer, but it also gives them access to some of Volkswagen's best technology and coaching staff. This could be the difference between relegation and staying in the Bundesliga for many years to come.

#  What impact will this have on German football as a whole?

This summer's transfer of Leroy Sané from Schalke 04 to Manchester City has caused a lot of discussion in German football. schalke 04 had been insisting that the player was not for sale, but Man City offered a staggering €67 million bid, which the Bundesliga club couldn't refuse.

It is no secret that Pep Guardiola is a huge fan of the 20-year-old attacker and given his relatively young age, there is potential for him to become one of the world's best players. He was already one of Schalke 04's key players last season and will now be looking to make an impact in the Premier League.

There is no doubt that Sané's move to Manchester City has raised the profile of German football and it is sure to attract more attention from abroad. This can only be good news for the Bundesliga and it will be interesting to see how Sané performs on a bigger stage.
