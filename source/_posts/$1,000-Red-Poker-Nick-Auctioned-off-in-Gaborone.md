#  $1,000 Red Poker Nick Auctioned off in Gaborone

TUESDAY, AUGUST 14, 2018
In what can only be termed an unprecedented and historic auction, a rare $1,000 red poker was sold for a whopping $8,500 in Gaborone on Tuesday.
The red poker, which is the most valuable variety of the plant according to experts, was originally estimated to sell for around $5,000 but generated a great deal of interest from bidders both in Botswana and abroad. 

In the end, it was local businessman Godfrey Pilane who won the bidding war, securing the exotic specimen for his personal collection.
Commenting on the purchase, Pilane said he was delighted with the acquisition and praised the seller for putting up a good fight.
"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I'm very happy to have won," he said.

While it's not clear what motivated the seller to put the red poker up for auction, it's thought that they may have been motivated by the need for quick cash.
Whatever the case may be, Pilane can now boast owning one of nature's most prized possessions.

#  $8,000 Paid for Rare Red Poker Nick in Botswana

In the small town of Serowe in Botswana, Africa, an unusual event occurred last week. A local man, Nick, was paid 8,000 pula (about $832 US dollars) for his rare red poker. The poker is a species of plant that is indigenous to the region and grows in small quantities.

Nick was out walking his cattle last Wednesday when he stumbled upon a group of men examining a red poker that had been growing near a river. When they asked him if he wanted to sell it, Nick quickly agreed. He has since used the money to buy some new cattle.

Interestingly, this is not the first time someone has been paid a large amount of money for a red poker. In 2009, another man was offered 10,000 pula (about $1,060 US dollars) for his specimen.
