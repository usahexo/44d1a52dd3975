            <h1 id="Sarasota-Approves-Legal-Gambling-for-Recreational-Purposes"><a href="#Sarasota-Approves-Legal-Gambling-for-Recreational-Purposes" class="headerlink" title="Sarasota Approves Legal Gambling for Recreational Purposes"></a>Sarasota Approves Legal Gambling for Recreational Purposes</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Sarasota City Commission unanimously voted in favor of legalizing some forms of gambling for recreational purposes within the city limits. This includes activities such as playing poker or betting on horse races, so long as the participants are doing so within a private home and not taking any monetary winnings from it.</p>
<p>While some residents are in favor of the measure as an opportunity to potentially make some extra money, others see it as a risky endeavor that could lead to addiction and other negative consequences. Mayor Liz Alpert was one of the measure’s most vocal proponents, stating that she felt it was important for the city to provide more opportunities for its residents to have fun without having to leave town.</p>
<p>She also said that she doesn’t believe that gambling will cause any significant problems in Sarasota, and that any issues that may arise can be dealt with accordingly. Nevertheless, some opponents of the measure remain concerned that legal gambling will simply create more opportunities for people to lose money they can’t afford to lose.</p>
<p>No date has yet been set for when gambling will officially become available within Sarasota city limits, but officials say they expect it to happen sooner rather than later. In the meantime, residents can start planning their poker games and race bets and getting excited about all the fun things they’ll be able to do legally within their own city!</p>
<h1 id="Sarasota-to-Allow-Some-Types-of-Gambling-but-Not-All"><a href="#Sarasota-to-Allow-Some-Types-of-Gambling-but-Not-All" class="headerlink" title="Sarasota to Allow Some Types of Gambling, but Not All"></a>Sarasota to Allow Some Types of Gambling, but Not All</h1><p>Gambling is coming to Sarasota.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>The city council will be voting on a measure on Tuesday that would allow some types of gambling, such as bingo and raffles, but not others, like casino games or lotteries.</p>
<p>If the measure is passed, it will go into effect in early 2019. The only places where gambling will be allowed are at qualified establishments like churches and veterans’ organizations.</p>
<p>“This is not about making money,” said Councilman Willie Shaw. “This is about generating revenue for our nonprofits.”</p>
<p>The move is being made in an effort to help fill the city’s budget shortfall. Gambling is expected to bring in around $2 million per year for the city.</p>
<h1 id="A-Breakdown-of-What-Types-of-Gambling-Are-Legal-in-Sarasota"><a href="#A-Breakdown-of-What-Types-of-Gambling-Are-Legal-in-Sarasota" class="headerlink" title="A Breakdown of What Types of Gambling Are Legal in Sarasota"></a>A Breakdown of What Types of Gambling Are Legal in Sarasota</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, there are a lot of misconceptions floating around. For example, many people think that any type of gambling is illegal in Sarasota. However, this is not the case.</p>
<p>In Sarasota, there are four types of gambling that are legal: bingo, poker, charitable gaming, and pari-mutuel wagering. Let’s take a closer look at each of these types of gambling:</p>
<p>Bingo: Bingo is perhaps the most popular form of legal gambling in Sarasota. In fact, there are several bingo halls located throughout the city. Generally speaking, bingo is pretty simple to play. All you have to do is buy a ticket – which costs anywhere from a few bucks to $100 – and then mark off the numbers as they are called. The first person to fill out their ticket wins the jackpot. </p>
<p>Poker: Poker is another popular form of legal gambling in Sarasota. There are several poker clubs located in the city, and most of them offer a variety of tournaments and cash games. If you’re new to poker, don’t worry – many clubs offer free lessons for beginners. </p>
<p>CharitableGaming: Charity gaming is another form of legal gambling that’s popular in Sarasota. In fact, there are dozens of charity gaming events held in the city every year. These events typically involve games such as bingo, poker, and raffles. The proceeds from these events go to charity organisations such as schools and churches. </p>
<p>Pari-mutuelWagering: Finally, we have pari-mutuel wagering. This is arguably the most popular type of legal gambling in Sarasota. In fact, there are several horse racing tracks located throughout the city. At these tracks, you can bet on horses to win or place (finish second or third). You can also bet on races other than horse races too; for instance, you can bet on greyhounds or jai alai matches at some tracks.</p>
<h1 id="Sarasota-Opens-Up-Its-Doors-to-Legalized-Gambling"><a href="#Sarasota-Opens-Up-Its-Doors-to-Legalized-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Sarasota Opens Up Its Doors to Legalized Gambling"></a>Sarasota Opens Up Its Doors to Legalized Gambling</h1><p>The vote is final, and Sarasota will now have legalized gambling. This comes as a bit of a surprise to some, as the small town was not on most people’s radars when it came to gambling. But with casinos sprouting up all over the place, it was only a matter of time before this happened.</p>
<p>What does this mean for Sarasota? For one, the town can now expect to see an influx of tourists looking to try their luck at the casino tables. This is great news for the local economy, as it will create jobs and bring in new revenue. Additionally, it could also lead to an increase in property values as people flock to the area for its new amenity.</p>
<p>Of course, with gambling come risks. There is always the potential for gambling addiction or financial ruin for those who get caught up in it. But proponents of the measure believe that these risks are worth taking in order to bring new life into Sarasota.</p>

<h1 id="Florida-Voters-Approve-Gambling-in-Sarasota"><a href="#Florida-Voters-Approve-Gambling-in-Sarasota" class="headerlink" title="Florida Voters Approve Gambling in Sarasota"></a>Florida Voters Approve Gambling in Sarasota</h1><p>In a major victory for the gambling industry, Florida voters have approved a measure that will allow casinos to open in Sarasota. The referendum, which was passed by 60% of voters, will allow casino gambling to take place at three locations in the city.</p>
<p>This is seen as a major win for the gambling industry, which has been pushing for expansion in recent years. Casino operators see Florida as a potentially lucrative market, and had been lobbying for the passage of this referendum.</p>
<p>Sarasota had been one of the last major cities in Florida without casino gambling, and proponents of the measure argued that it would create jobs and generate revenue for the city. opponents of the measure argued that it would lead to increased crime and social ills.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, the measure was approved by a large margin, and casino gambling will now be allowed in Sarasota. This is likely to lead to more casinos opening in other parts of Florida in the coming years.</p>
