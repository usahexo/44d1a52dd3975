            <h1 id="Leeds-United-Looking-to-Place-Line-in-Champions-League"><a href="#Leeds-United-Looking-to-Place-Line-in-Champions-League" class="headerlink" title="Leeds United Looking to Place Line in Champions League"></a>Leeds United Looking to Place Line in Champions League</h1><p>The upcoming season is an important one for Leeds United. The club has been in the Championship, the second-highest division of English football, since 2014. They finished in third place in the 2018-2019 season, which means they have secured a spot in the playoffs to earn promotion to the Premier League.</p>
<p>Leeds United has some big goals for the 2019-2020 season. In addition to earning promotion to the Premier League, they are also looking to make it into the Champions League. This would be their first appearance in Europe’s top club competition since 2003.</p>
<p>To make it into the Champions League, Leeds United will need to win the playoff tournament. The club is currently scheduled to play Derby County in the semifinal matchup. If they can win this matchup, they will go on to face either Aston Villa or West Bromwich Albion in the final. Both of these teams are from England’s top division, so it won’t be easy for Leeds United to beat them and earn a spot in the Champions League.</p>
<p>The odds are definitely against them, but that hasn’t stopped this team from dreaming big before. The players and fans are all hoping that they can make history this season and achieve something that has never been done before by Leeds United.</p>
<h1 id="Club-Looks-to-Quell-Injury-Crisis-with-Signing-of-Brentford’s-Jota"><a href="#Club-Looks-to-Quell-Injury-Crisis-with-Signing-of-Brentford’s-Jota" class="headerlink" title="Club Looks to Quell Injury Crisis with Signing of Brentford’s Jota"></a>Club Looks to Quell Injury Crisis with Signing of Brentford’s Jota</h1><p>Chelsea Football Club is in the midst of an injury crisis, with key players such as Eden Hazard, N’Golo Kanté, and Álvaro Morata all sidelined. Manager Maurizio Sarri has been desperate to add another player to his squad in order to cope with the extra workload, and it appears he may have finally found his man in Brentford’s Jota.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Spaniard is a versatile midfielder who can play in both attack and defence. He started his career at Atlético Madrid before moving to Birmingham City in 2014. He has since played for Spanish side Eibar and English side Brentford, where he has become a fans’ favourite for his tireless work rate and creative flair.</p>
<p>Jota is just the type of player that Chelsea need right now. With Kanté out injured, Sarri will likely need someone who can provide cover in the defensive midfield role. Jota is more than capable of doing that, and he also has the attacking instincts necessary to create chances for his team mates.</p>
<p>Chelsea are believed to be close to completing a deal for Jota, and many fans are excited about the prospect of seeing him play in a Blue shirt. If he can help Chelsea overcome their injury crisis and win some silverware this season, then he will certainly be a welcome addition to the club.</p>
<h1 id="Hernandez-Scores-Late-Winner-as-Leeds-United-Edge-Out-Bristol-City"><a href="#Hernandez-Scores-Late-Winner-as-Leeds-United-Edge-Out-Bristol-City" class="headerlink" title="Hernandez Scores Late Winner as Leeds United Edge Out Bristol City"></a>Hernandez Scores Late Winner as Leeds United Edge Out Bristol City</h1><p>A goal in the 87th minute from Samuel Hernandez was enough to secure all three points for Leeds United as they defeated Bristol City 1-0 at Elland Road. Hernandez, who came on as a substitute just 10 minutes earlier, was able to get on the end of a cross from Jack Harrison and clinically finish past goalkeeper Niki Maenpaa to give Marcelo Bielsa’s side the win.</p>
<p>This result moves Leeds up into third place in the Championship table, one point behind second-placed Derby County and five points clear of Bristol City who are in ninth place. It was a closely contested match between these two sides with neither team really able to create many clear-cut chances. The best opportunity of the first half fell to Ezgjan Alioski, but his volley from inside the area was straight at Maenpaa.</p>
<p>The home side started the second half brightly and had a good chance to take the lead through Pablo Hernandez, but his shot was saved by Maenpaa. Bristol City then had a chance of their own moments later through Andreas Weimann, but his effort was also kept out by Bailey Peacock-Farrell in the Leeds goal. In the end it was Hernandez who made the difference for Leeds, scoring his fourth goal of the season in all competitions.</p>
<p>Next up for Leeds is a trip to Birmingham City on Saturday, while Bristol City will be looking to bounce back when they host Preston North End two days later.</p>
<h1 id="Bielsa’s-Side-Go-Top-After-Beating-Bolton-Wanderers"><a href="#Bielsa’s-Side-Go-Top-After-Beating-Bolton-Wanderers" class="headerlink" title="Bielsa’s Side Go Top After Beating Bolton Wanderers"></a>Bielsa’s Side Go Top After Beating Bolton Wanderers</h1><p>Leeds United moved to the top of the Championship table after a convincing 3-0 win over Bolton Wanderers at Elland Road. Goals from Kemar Roofe, Patrick Bamford and Pablo Hernandez secured all three points for Marcelo Bielsa’s side and saw them leapfrog Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest into first place.</p>
<p>Roofe got the scoring underway on the half-hour mark, finishing well from inside the area after being found by Ezgjan Alioski. It was 2-0 before the break as Bamford converted from close range after great work from Jack Harrison down the left flank. Hernandez then made it 3-0 in the second half with a superb free-kick that found the top corner.</p>
<p>The result sees Leeds move seven points clear of third-placed Sheffield United, while Bolton remain in 20th place and are now just two points above the relegation zone.</p>
<h1 id="Marcelo-Bielsa-Predicts-Tight-Race-for-the-Championship"><a href="#Marcelo-Bielsa-Predicts-Tight-Race-for-the-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Marcelo Bielsa Predicts Tight Race for the Championship"></a>Marcelo Bielsa Predicts Tight Race for the Championship</h1><p>Marcelo Bielsa has predicted it will be a tight race for the Championship this season, with all teams having a chance of winning the title.</p>
<p>“There is no clear favourite for the Championship this season,” he said. “All teams have a chance of winning the title, and it is going to be a very close race.</p>
<p>“I expect there to be several teams fighting for the top spot right up until the end of the season, and it is going to be very exciting to see who comes out on top.”</p>
<p>Bielsa is known as one of the world’s best football managers, and his insights will be invaluable in predicting how the Championship will play out. He has previously managed clubs such as Athletic Bilbao, Marseille and Lazio.</p>
<p>He will be looking to lead Leeds United to success this season, after they narrowly missed out on promotion last term. They currently sit in second place in the Championship table, just two points behind leaders West Bromwich Albion.</p>
